4. **FileItem** - Individual file rendering
   - Shows file name, date, and preview text

### State Management

- **Vault event handlers** - Debounced refresh on file changes
- **RefreshCounter** pattern for forcing re-renders

### Integration Features

- Context menus (right-click on files/folders)
- Drag and drop functionality

### Low Priority

- Auto-reveal active file setting

## Summary
The core functionality is complete! The plugin now:
- Renders folder tree and file list
- Persists state across reloads
- Updates on vault changes
- Integrates with Obsidian commands
- Has a clean React architecture

Ready for testing in Obsidian! ðŸŽ‰
