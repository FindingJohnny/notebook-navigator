### Folder Display

- **Show root folder:** Display "Vault" as the root folder in the tree

    - `yyyy-MM-dd` = 2024-01-05

### Advanced

- **Confirm before deleting files:** Show confirmation dialog when deleting files or folders

## Tips and Tricks

### Creating beautiful note lists

Combine Notebook Navigator with the [Featured Image plugin](https://github.com/johansan/obsidian-featured-image) to display thumbnail previews in your file list:

1. Install the Featured Image plugin
2. Enable "Show feature image" in Notebook Navigator settings
3. Your notes will automatically display thumbnails from the first image

#### Optimizing thumbnail performance

For best performance with Notebook Navigator's 42px thumbnails, configure these Featured Image plugin settings:

- **Create resized thumbnail:** `true`
- **Resized thumbnail frontmatter property:** `featureResized`
- **Max resized width:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Max resized height:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Fill resized dimensions:** `true`

Then in Notebook Navigator settings:
- **Feature image property:** `featureResized`

This creates optimized 42px thumbnails that load quickly and display perfectly in the file list, rather than loading full-size images.

### Organizing with pins

Pin frequently accessed notes to keep them at the top:
1. Right-click any file
2. Select "Pin note"
3. Pinned notes appear at the top with a üìå icon

### Quick navigation patterns

- **Quick file access:** Press Tab from folders to jump to files
- **Parent folder navigation:** Press Left arrow to go up the folder tree
- **Rapid browsing:** Hold arrow keys for continuous navigation
- **Focus management:** The focused pane has a subtle border highlight

### Managing draft and private notes

Use the "Excluded files" setting to hide notes with specific frontmatter properties:

1. Add properties like `draft, private, archived` to the excluded files list
2. Add frontmatter to your notes:
   ```yaml
   ---
   draft: true
   ---
   ```
3. These files will be automatically hidden from the navigator

This is perfect for:
- Work-in-progress notes
- Personal/sensitive content
- Archived notes you want to keep but not see daily
- Template files with a `template: true` property

## Compatibility

- Works with all Obsidian themes
- Compatible with other file management plugins
- **Desktop only** - This plugin is only available for desktop versions of Obsidian
- Respects Obsidian's safe mode

## Support

If you have any questions, suggestions, or issues, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator).

## Development

This plugin is open source and built with a modern React/TypeScript stack. Contributions are welcome!

### Built with Modern React Architecture

Notebook Navigator is built using React and TypeScript, providing:

- ‚ö° **Lightning-fast performance** with React's virtual DOM and optimized rendering
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular architecture** with reusable components and custom hooks
- üîí **Type safety** with TypeScript strict mode throughout the codebase
- üß† **Smart state management** using React Context API for predictable updates
- üîÑ **Automatic memory cleanup** preventing leaks with proper lifecycle management
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-friendly** with hot module reloading and React DevTools support

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator.git
cd notebook-navigator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for development (with watch mode)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Technical Stack

- **React** - Component-based UI with hooks and Context API
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety with strict mode
- **esbuild** - Lightning-fast bundling and development builds
- **Obsidian API** - Deep integration with Obsidian's plugin system

### Architecture Highlights

- **Component-based design** - Each UI element is a self-contained React component
- **Custom hooks** - Reusable logic for keyboard navigation, context menus, and drag-and-drop
- **Context providers** - Centralized state management without prop drilling
- **Service layer** - Clean separation of business logic from UI components
- **Zero setTimeout/DOM manipulation** - Pure React patterns for predictable behavior
