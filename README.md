- **Excluded notes:** Comma-separated list of frontmatter properties. Notes containing any of these properties will be hidden (e.g., draft, private, archived)

## Tips and Tricks

### Creating beautiful note lists

Combine Notebook Navigator with the [Featured Image plugin](https://github.com/johansan/obsidian-featured-image) to display thumbnail previews in your file list:

1. Install the Featured Image plugin
2. Enable "Show feature image" in Notebook Navigator settings
3. Your notes will automatically display thumbnails from the first image

#### Optimizing thumbnail performance

For best performance with Notebook Navigator's 42px thumbnails, configure these Featured Image plugin settings:

- **Create resized thumbnail:** `true`
- **Resized thumbnail frontmatter property:** `featureResized`
- **Max resized width:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Max resized height:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Fill resized dimensions:** `true`

Then in Notebook Navigator settings:
- **Feature image property:** `featureResized`

This creates optimized 42px thumbnails that load quickly and display perfectly in the file list, rather than loading full-size images.

### Using folder notes

Turn folders into clickable links for better organization:

1. Enable "Enable folder notes" in settings
2. Right-click a folder and select "Create folder note" to create an associated note
3. Folders with notes appear as clickable links (visually distinguished with an underline)
4. Click the folder name to open its note directly
5. Click anywhere else on the folder row to view the folder's file list as usual
6. Right-click and select "Delete folder note" to remove the association

Folder notes are perfect for:
- Project overviews and documentation
- Category descriptions
- Table of contents for folder contents
- Meeting notes or journals organized by folder

**Tips:**
- Set a custom folder note name like "index" or "readme" in settings
- Hide folder notes from file lists to keep things clean
- When you rename a folder, its folder note is automatically renamed too (if using folder name)
- Folders without notes still work normally - click to select and view their files

### Organizing with pins

Pin frequently accessed notes to keep them at the top:
1. Right-click any file
2. Select "Pin note"
3. Pinned notes appear at the top with a üìå icon

### Customizing folder colors and icons

Add visual organization to your folders with custom colors and icons:

1. Right-click any folder
2. Select "Change color" or "Change icon"
3. Choose from a palette of colors or variety of Lucide icons
4. To remove, right-click and select "Remove color" or "Remove icon"

Visual customization helps you:
- Quickly identify different types of content at a glance
- Highlight important project folders
- Create a more personalized and intuitive navigation experience
- Combine colors and icons for even better organization

### Using tags effectively

The tags section provides powerful ways to organize and find your notes:

- **Hierarchical organization:** Use nested tags like `#project/work/urgent` to create tag hierarchies
- **Quick filtering:** Click any tag to see all notes with that tag and its subtags
- **Untagged notes:** Find notes without tags by clicking "Untagged"

### Managing draft and private notes

Use the "Excluded files" setting to hide notes with specific frontmatter properties:

1. Add properties like `draft, private, archived` to the excluded files list
2. Add frontmatter to your notes:
   ```yaml
   ---
   draft: true
   ---
   ```
3. These files will be automatically hidden from the navigator

This is perfect for:
- Work-in-progress notes
- Personal/sensitive content
- Archived notes you want to keep but not see daily
- Template files with a `template: true` property
