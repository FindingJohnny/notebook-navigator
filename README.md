### File Organization

  - Simple names: `resources, templates`
  - Wildcards: `*-archive, temp-*, _*` (matches folders like `2023-archive`, `temp-notes`, `_private`)

### Note Display

- **Title rows:** Display note titles in 1 or 2 rows (default: 1 row). Use 2 rows for longer titles
- **Show date:** Display the date below note names
  - **Date format:** Format for displaying dates (uses date-fns format)
    - Common formats:
      - `MMM d, yyyy` = Jan 5, 2024
      - `dd/MM/yyyy` = 05/01/2024
      - `yyyy-MM-dd` = 2024-01-05

    - **Tip:** Use the [Featured Image plugin](https://github.com/johansan/obsidian-featured-image) (also available in community plugins) to automatically set feature images for all your notes based on the first image in each document!
    - **Important!** In Featured Image plugin you can choose to create resized thumbnails, this will significantly improve performance! Use 42 pixels for maximum performance, or 84 pixels for retina displays. The resized property is called `featureResized` by default.

## Tips and Tricks

### Creating beautiful note lists

Combine Notebook Navigator with the [Featured Image plugin](https://github.com/johansan/obsidian-featured-image) to display thumbnail previews in your file list:

1. Install the Featured Image plugin
2. Enable "Show feature image" in Notebook Navigator settings
3. Your notes will automatically display thumbnails from the first image

#### Optimizing thumbnail performance

For best performance with Notebook Navigator's 42px thumbnails, configure these Featured Image plugin settings:

- **Create resized thumbnail:** `true`
- **Resized thumbnail frontmatter property:** `featureResized`
- **Max resized width:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Max resized height:** `42` (or `84` for retina displays)
- **Fill resized dimensions:** `true`

Then in Notebook Navigator settings:
- **Feature image property:** `featureResized`

This creates optimized 42px thumbnails that load quickly and display perfectly in the file list, rather than loading full-size images.

### Organizing with pins

Pin frequently accessed notes to keep them at the top:
1. Right-click any file
2. Select "Pin note"
3. Pinned notes appear at the top with a üìå icon

### Customizing folder colors and icons

Add visual organization to your folders with custom colors and icons:

1. Right-click any folder
2. Select "Change color" or "Change icon"
3. Choose from a palette of colors or variety of Lucide icons
4. To remove, right-click and select "Remove color" or "Remove icon"

Visual customization helps you:
- Quickly identify different types of content at a glance
- Highlight important project folders
- Create a more personalized and intuitive navigation experience
- Combine colors and icons for even better organization

### Using tags effectively

The tags section provides powerful ways to organize and find your notes:

- **Hierarchical organization:** Use nested tags like `#project/work/urgent` to create tag hierarchies
- **Quick filtering:** Click any tag to see all notes with that tag and its subtags
- **Untagged notes:** Find notes without tags by clicking "Untagged"

### Managing draft and private notes

Use the "Excluded files" setting to hide notes with specific frontmatter properties:

1. Add properties like `draft, private, archived` to the excluded files list
2. Add frontmatter to your notes:
   ```yaml
   ---
   draft: true
   ---
   ```
3. These files will be automatically hidden from the navigator

This is perfect for:
- Work-in-progress notes
- Personal/sensitive content
- Archived notes you want to keep but not see daily
- Template files with a `template: true` property
