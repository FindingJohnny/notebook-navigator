# React Refactor Tasks - Progress Tracker

## Task 1: High-Priority Fixes and Refinements

### 1.1. Simplify PaneHeader.tsx
- [x] Modify PaneHeader.tsx to accept props for title and button configurations
- [x] Add "Expand/Collapse All" and "New Folder" buttons for folder pane
- [x] Add "New File" button for file pane
- [x] Implement click handlers using context

**Completed:** PaneHeader now shows proper buttons with icons, handles expand/collapse all folders, and creates new files/folders using FileSystemService.

### 1.2. Refine State Management in AppContext.tsx
- [x] Refactor useAppContext to use useReducer
- [x] Move leftPaneWidth to NotebookNavigatorComponent.tsx
- [x] Decouple localStorage from state updates

**Completed:** 
- Implemented reducer with action types for all state changes
- Moved leftPaneWidth to local component state with localStorage persistence
- localStorage saves are now handled within reducer actions, not as side effects
- All components updated to use dispatch instead of setAppState

### 1.3. Improve Vault Event Handling in AppContext.tsx
- [x] Create specific handlers for create, delete, rename, modify
- [x] Optimize re-renders for different event types
- [x] Refine debouncing strategy

**Completed:** 
- Each vault event type now has its own handler and timeout
- Delete/rename events trigger cleanup of deleted items
- Create events have minimal debounce (50ms)
- Modify events have longer debounce (200ms)
- Only necessary components re-render via refreshCounter

## Task 2: Code Cleanup and Minor Refactoring

### 2.1. Remove useVaultEvents.ts
- [x] Delete the useVaultEvents.ts file
- [x] Remove any imports and usages

**Completed:** Removed redundant hook - no imports found, functionality already handled in AppContext

### 2.2. Clean Up NotebookNavigatorView.tsx
- [x] Remove global callbacks
- [x] Implement ref-based communication

**Completed:** 
- Removed global callback functions
- Implemented forwardRef in NotebookNavigatorComponent
- Used React.createRef in NotebookNavigatorView
- Methods exposed via useImperativeHandle

### 2.3. Consolidate Type Definitions
- [x] Move VIEW_TYPE_NOTEBOOK_NAVIGATOR_REACT to types.ts
- [x] Remove old VIEW_TYPE_NOTEBOOK
- [x] Update all references

**Completed:** 
- Moved view type constant to types.ts
- Replaced old VIEW_TYPE_NOTEBOOK with new constant
- Updated imports in NotebookNavigatorView.tsx and main.ts

## Task 3: Architectural and Future-Proofing Enhancements

### 3.1. Abstract FileSystemService
- [x] Create ServicesContext
- [x] Provide services at root
- [x] Update components to use ServicesContext

**Completed:** 
- Created ServicesContext with FileSystemOperations
- Wrapped app with ServicesProvider at root
- Removed fileSystemOps from AppContext
- Updated PaneHeader to use useFileSystemOps hook

### 3.2. Implement Keyboard Navigation
- [x] Create useKeyboardNavigation hook
- [x] Add event listeners
- [x] Implement navigation logic
- [x] Update state appropriately

**Completed:** 
- Created comprehensive useKeyboardNavigation hook
- Handles Arrow keys for navigation, Tab for pane switching
- Enter to open files/toggle folders
- Delete/Backspace for file/folder deletion
- Proper scroll into view and focus management
- Debounced to prevent rapid key presses

### 3.3. Add Context Menus
- [x] Create useContextMenu hook
- [x] Apply to FolderItem and FileItem
- [x] Define menu items

**Completed:** 
- Created comprehensive useContextMenu hook
- Full folder menu: New note/folder/canvas/base, duplicate, search, rename, delete
- Full file menu: Open options, pin/unpin, duplicate, version history, rename, delete
- Applied to both FolderItem and FileItem components

## Summary

All tasks have been completed successfully! The React refactor has:

1. **Improved Architecture:**
   - Clean React component structure with hooks
   - Centralized state management using useReducer
   - Services abstracted into separate context
   - Ref-based communication instead of global callbacks

2. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Full keyboard navigation support
   - Complete context menus for files and folders
   - Proper PaneHeader with functional buttons
   - Optimized vault event handling

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Removed redundant code and files
   - Consolidated type definitions
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved testability and maintainability

The plugin is now fully refactored with React and ready for production use!
